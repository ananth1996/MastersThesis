\chapter{Conclusions and Future Work}
\label{chp:conclusion}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Explain the quality of results with the election perspective
    \item Future work is to extend this to other election settings and investigate generality of this approach
    \item Possible future work in congressional voting data
    \item Can also tackle the other problem in information cascade theory of how to predict who is most likely to vote next 
    \item This can lead to a complete model of election dynamics and could incorporate elements of game theory and network inference 
\end{itemize}
