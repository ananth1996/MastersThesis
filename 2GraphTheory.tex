\chapter{Graph Theory}
\label{chp:graph-theory}
In this chapter we will provide the fundamentals of the graph theory concepts required to understand the rest of the thesis. In Section~\ref{sec:prelim} we cover the basic definitions, terminologies used to describe different types of graphs. Then we define a signed graph and discuss its unique properties in Section~\ref{sec:signed-graphs}. We outline the theory of balance in signed networks and methods to measure it in Section~\ref{sec:balance-theory}.Next, we discuss the theory of status and illustrate the differences to balance in Section~\ref{sec:status-theory}. Lastly, we explain techniques of finding hierarchies in directed networks and the concept of agony in Section~\ref{sec:hierarchy}.

\section{Preliminaries}
\label{sec:prelim}
In this section we define the various types of graphs and their basic properties. The notation and terminologies used closely follows those used in Diestel~\cite{diestel1997graph}. Graphs are structures that describe relationships between entities. These entities are called \textit{vertices} and entities related to one another are joined by edges. The terms graph, vertices and edges can be used interchangeably with \textit{network}, \textit{nodes} and \textit{links} respectively.

Graphs can be classified broadly into two types based on whether the edges posses a direction or not. We now go on to define them in detail.
\subsection{Undirected Graphs}
An undirected graph is pair $G=(V,E)$, where $V$ is the set of vertices and $E$ is the set $E \subseteq \{ (u,v) \mid u,v \in V\}$ of unordered pairs of vertices called edges. In this thesis we will deal with only \textit{simple graphs}, i.e. no are so self loops $(u,v)\in V \times V, ~ u\neq v$ and there is at most one edge between vertices $u$ and $v$.

The number of the vertices in a graph is called the \textit{order} of the graphs is denoted by $n= |G|$ and the \textit{size} of a graph is the number of edges denoted by $m = \|G\|$ or $m=|E|$. A vertex $u$ is \textit{adjacent} to $v$ is they are the end points of an edge, $(u,v) \in E$. All the vertices adjacent to vertex $v$ is called the \textit{neighbourhood} of $v$ and is denoted by $N(v)$.
