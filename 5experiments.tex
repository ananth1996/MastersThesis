\chapter{Experiments}
\label{chp:experiments}
In this chapter, we will outline the experiments carried out on the Wikipedia elections of administrators using the vote predicition models that we presented in chapter~\ref{chp:vote-prediction}.
Firstly, we describe the existing sources of data from Wikipedia and the datasets used in the experiments in Section~\ref{sec:datasets}.
Next, in Section~\ref{sec:linear-combination-implementation}, we discuss the implementation of the linear combination of graph model described in Section~\ref{sec:linear-combination-theory}.
Then, we cover the implementation of the vote predicition models based on the theories of balance and status in signed networks in Section~\ref{sec:local-signed-network-implementation}.
Furthermore, in Section~\ref{sec:voting-order}, we discuss the experiments conducted on the voting order and its impact on the predictive power of the models proposed.
Lastly, we explain the metrics which we can ue to evaluate the performance of the models in Section~\ref{sec:eval-metrics}.


\section{Datasets}

\subsection{Graphs}
    Discuss the process of extraction of the various graphs discussed in the previous sections
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Agree Graphs and Follows Graph}, where we measure the degree to which one user agrees and follows another user in previous elections
        \item \textbf{Topic similarity} from the top 100 articles edited for each user and the pairwise Jaccard similarity 
        \item \textbf{Talk and Interaction graphs}, measures communication between users on their respective user talk pages
        \item \textbf{Signed Graphs}, triad encoding and extracting the triad counts for each voter. 
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Data Preparation}
    Discuss the data split into
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Dev

    \end{itemize}
\subsection{Linear models}
    Discuss how any other supervised classification model can be used in its place.

    Discuss using the class weights to learn balanced prediction models and how otherwise they end up overcompensating due to the class imbalance.
