\chapter{Introduction}



In recent years, researchers have become increasingly interested in understanding the behaviour of voters in social networks. Knowledge of the factors that motivate voters, for example, voting for bills in the United States Congress \cite{karimi2019multicongress} or electing administrators in Wikipedia \cite{jankowski-lorek2013MBSN,cabunducan2011voting,lee2012uncovering}, is of great importance in selecting successful policies or candidates. Voting is a classic problem and has been studied in the fields of game theory and political science \cite{zou2015strategicDoodle,kearns2009behavioral,tal2015a}. More recently, there is a focus on using information from the interaction network of voters to model their behaviour. This provides an insight into these interactions and effect of influence of other individuals on voters within a community.

Votes can be represented as a \textit{signed} network with positive or negative links. Finding groups using clustering techniques \cite{brito2020aBrazil,levorato2016brazilian,chiang2014prediction} and predicting signed links \cite{leskovec2010predicting,leskovec2010signed,chiang2011exploiting} in these networks is well researched. These approaches provide understanding of the group dynamics at play and predict votes and in such a network. However, they do not consider the iterative and chronological nature of the voting that takes place in these networks. Moreover, in cases where research does focus on voter models, they rely on external features to build machine learning models that are task-specific and static \cite{karimi2019multicongress,jankowski-lorek2013MBSN}.

In this thesis, we propose a model that creates a local signed network consisting of the neighbours of the current voter and the votes already cast in the election in question. It will then predict the vote that when added to the network will comply the most with concepts of balance and status in signed networks. After all the votes are cast in a session, the model can be easily updated to improve quality and is, therefore, iterative and dynamic. The model is also flexible and can incorporate external features to build the local signed network of a voter. The results for Wikipedia administrator elections shows that our model outperforms machine learning based models and traditional signed link prediction solutions. 

\section{Thesis Outline}
The rest of the thesis is organized in the following manner. Firstly, we discuss the background relating to signed graphs and hierarchy in directed networks in Chapter~\ref{chp:graph-theory}. Next, in Chapter~\ref{chp:vote-prediction} we describe the vote prediction problem and approaches to solving it. Chapter~\ref{chp:wikipedia} provides a comprehensive view of Wikipedia and the election process for administrators. In Chapter~\ref{chp:implementation} we explain the datasets used, construction of the model and evaluation criteria. After that, we report our findings in Chapter~\ref{chp:results} and discuss their implications. Finally, we conclude the thesis and present future work in Chapter~\ref{chp:conclusion}.
